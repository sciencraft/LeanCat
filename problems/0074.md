Theorem: Let $\mathcal C$ be a small category. A category $\mathcal L$ containing $\mathcal C$ as a full subcategory is an
pro-completion of $\mathcal C$ if and only if the following conditions hold:

(1) $\mathcal L$ has cofiltered colimits,

(2) every object of $\mathcal L$ is the colimit of a cofiltered diagram in $\mathcal C$, and

(3) every object of $\mathcal C$ is finitely copresentable in $\mathcal L$.
