Def: A functor is called $\textbf{left exact}$ if it preserves all finite limits.


Theorem: Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be abelian categories and let $F:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ be a functor.
    Then $F$ is left exact if and only if $F$ is additive and $F$ maps exact sequence $0\to x\to y\to z$ to $0\to F(x)\to F(y)\to F(z)$.
