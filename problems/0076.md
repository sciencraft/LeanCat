Theorem: Let $\mathcal Set^{fin}$ be the category of finite sets and functions. Its pro-completion is the category
$$ \mathrm{Pro}(\mathcal Set^{fin}) = \mathcal Stone$$
of Stone spaces, i.e. compact topological spaces in which distinct elements can be separated by
clopen subsets. Morphisms are the continuous functions.
