Theorem: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the non-full subcategory of $\mathcal{L}\mathrm{at}_{\lor}^{\infty}$ whose objects are suplattice and  morphisms are meet- and join-preserving maps.
    In the consturcts $\mathcal{C}$, there exists a free object over $x$ if and only if the cardinality of $x$ is not greater than 2, i.e. $|x|\leq 2$.
