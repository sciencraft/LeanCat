Def: A category is called $\textbf{normal}$ if each monomorphism is a kernel.

Def: A category is called $\textbf{conormal}$ if each epimorphism is a cokernel.

Def: A category is called $\textbf{binormal}$ if it is both normal and conormal.

Def: Let $\mathcal C$ be a category.
An object $c\in\mathcal C$ is called $\textbf{mono-simple}$ if it has no proper subobjects.
An object $c\in\mathcal C$ is called $\textbf{epi-simple}$ if it has no proper quotient objects.


Theorem: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a binormal category.
    Then an object is mono-simple if and only if it is epi-simple.
