Def: Let $\mathcal C$ be a locally small category. 
An object $c \in\mathcal C$ is called $\textbf{compact}$ if $\mathrm{hom}_{\mathcal C} (x,-)$ preserves filtered colimits.


Theorem: Let $A$ be a ring. 
    For the category of right $A$-modules $\mathcal{A}\mathrm{b}_A$, an object is compact if and only if it is a finitely presentable $A$-module. Every $A$-module can be realized as a direct limit of finitely presented A-module.
