Def: Let $\mathcal C$ be a category. Let $S$ be a family of subobjects $(s_n,i_n)$ of an object $c\in \mathcal C$, indexed by a class $I$. 
A subobject $(x,i:x\to c)$ of $c$ is called an $\textbf{intersection}$ of $S$ provided that the following two conditions are satisfied:

(1) $i$ factors through each $i_n$ i.e., for each $n$ there exists an $f_n:x\to s_n$ with $i = i_n \circ  f_n$,

(2) if a morphism $f: z\to c$ factors through each $i_n$, then it factors through $i$.

Def: A category $\mathcal C$ is said to $\textbf{have intersections}$ if for each object $c\in\mathcal C$ and every family of subobjects of $c$, there exists an intersection.

Def: A category is said to be $\textbf{strongly complete}$ if it is complete and has intersections.


Theorem: A strongly cocomplete category with a separating set is strongly complete.
