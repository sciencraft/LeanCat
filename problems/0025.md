Theorem: Let $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{D}$, $\mathcal{E}$ be categories and $U : \mathcal{D}\to \mathcal{C}$, $V : \mathcal{E}\to \mathcal{C}$, $F : \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{E}$ be functors such that $V \circ F = U$.
    Suppose $U, V$ have left adjoints and $\mathcal D$ have coequalizers. If $V$ reflects split epimorphisms to regular epimorphisms (or equiavalently, the counit of the adjunction of $U$ is a regular epimorphism), then $F$ has a left adjoint.
