Def: A concrete category $(\mathcal C, U)$ over $\mathcal B$ is said to $\textbf{have (small) concrete limits}$ if $\mathcal C$ has all small limits and $U$ preserves them.


Theorem: Let $(\mathcal{C},U)$ have small concrete limits. 
    Then $U$ reflects small limits if and only if $U$ reflects isomorphisms.
