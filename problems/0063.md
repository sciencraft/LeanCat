Def: Let $\mathcal C$ be a locally small category. 
An object $c \in\mathcal C$ is called $\textbf{compact}$ if $\mathrm{hom}_{\mathcal C} (x,-)$ preserves filtered colimits.


Theorem: For $\mathcal{G}\mathrm{rp}$, an object is compact if and only if it is finitely presented as a group. Every group can be realized as a direct limit of finitely presented groups.
