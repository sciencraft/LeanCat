Def: A category is called sifted if the category of cocones over any finite discrete family of objects in it is connected.


Notation: $\mathrm{Rec}(\mathcal{C})$ := free cocompletion of $\mathcal{C}$ under reflexive coequalizers.


Theorem: For a sifted category with pullbacks $\mathcal C$, $\mathrm{Rec}(\mathcal C)$ is filtered.
